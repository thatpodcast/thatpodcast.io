<p>
That's right, Beau and Dave are back! After what turned out to be a whole month since their last episode, the spend some time catching up on a bunch of things that have gone on in that time. Most importantly, Dave explains why dogs need passports. Who knew? Plus some other techy things. They keep it a little shorter than usual (only an hour and a half, yo!) on account of Dave not feeling so well. Also,
 Dave quits That Podcast because nobody has ever used his awesome voicemail app. Oh wait, no, that is a lie. He didn't quit. The other
 part was true about nobody leaving a voicemail, though. It makes them both sad.
